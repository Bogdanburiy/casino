                    <p>Gambling means for the majority of our Users, entertainment, fun and excitement. But we also know
                        that for some of our Users gambling has negative side effects. In the medical science is
                        pathologic gambling since many years as serious sickness recognised.</p>

                        Gambling” We understand multiple steps of measures, with which a gambling provider can help to
                        lower the possibility of negative side effects appearing. -In case they already appear we also
                        try to take active steps against them.</p>
                    <p>The most important instrument against negative side effects from gambling are knowledge and
                        education about the risks of gambling too support our Users self-control in order to make sure

                    <p>We recommend you think about the following hints, before gambling in order to insure gambling
                        stays fun for You and without any negative side effects: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set yourself a deposit limit <br>
                            Before you start to gambling think about how much you can afford to gamble with according to
                            Your financial situation. Play with amounts which are for fun and for Your entertainment
                        </li>
                        <li>Do not try to win back a loss at every cost<br>
                            Try to not take to huge risks to win back what You lost before at any cost. Play for
                            Entertainment and not to earn money.</li>
                        <li>Set yourself a time limit<br>
                            Set yourself a time limit and do not break it. Keep in mind gambling should stay in balance
                            with your other hobbies and not be Your only hobby. </li>
                        <li>Play smart:<br>
                            It is smarter to not play, when You are extremely stressed, depressed or under to much
                            pressure. Also do not play when you are under the influence of Medications, Drugs or
                            Alcohol.</li>
                        <li>Take breaks:<br>
                            You should take breaks when You notice, that You get tired or can´t concentrate anymore</li>
                        <li>Only one account:<br>
                            To make it easier to have an overview how much time and money You spend on gambling it is
                            highly advised to not create more than one Account per Person.</li>
                    </ul>

                        different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for
                        you. “Self-Exclusion” means, that You exclude yourself, out of Your own choice, from all
                        gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to
                        self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span
                        between 6 months and 5 years. They also will explain you all future steps and what is needed
                        from you.</p>

                        new Account during Self Exclusion is a violation of our Terms of Service and may result in the
                        permanent ban of your original account. </p>
