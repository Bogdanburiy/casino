                    <h4>Region one: Low risk:</h4>
                    <p>For every nation from the region one the three-step verification is done as described earlier.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Region two: Medium risk:</h4>
                    <p>For every nation from the region two the three-step verification will be done at lower deposit,
                        withdraw and tip amounts. Step one will be done as usually. Step two will be done after
                        depositing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars), withdrawing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars) or tipping
                        another user/customer 500$ (five hundred Dollars.) Step three will be done after depositing
                        2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars), withdrawing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars)
                        or tipping another user/customer 1000$ (one thousand Dollars). Also, users from a low risk
                        region that change crypto currency in any other currency will be treated like user/customers
                        from a medium risk region. </p>
                    <h4>Region three: High risk:</h4>
                    <p>Regions of high risks will be banned. High risk regions will be regularly updated to keep up with
                        the changing environment of a fast-changing world. </p>
                    <p><strong>***Verification and confirmation of documents to confirm the identity of clients is
                            carried out automatically by artificial intelligence within a couple of minutes after
                            sending and filling in all the information by the client. The employee may, if necessary,
                            conduct additional checks based on the situation.</strong></p>
                    <h3>Additional measurements.</h3>
                    <p>In addition, an AI which is overseen by the AML compliance officer will look for any unusual
                        behaviour and report it right away to a employee of www.chc.casino.</p>
                    <p>According to a risk based few and general experience the human employees will recheck all checks
                        which are done bevor by the AI or other employees and may redo or do additional checks according
                        to the situation. </p>
                    <p>In addition, a data Scientist supported by modern, electronic, analytic systems will look for
                        unusual behaviour like: Depositing and withdrawing without longer Betting sessions. Attempts to
                        use a different Bank account to for Deposit and Withdraw, nationality changes, currency changes,
                        behaviour and activity changes as well as checks, if an account is used by it´s original owner.
                        Also a User has to use the same method for Withdraw as he used for Deposit, for the amount of
                        the initial Deposit to prevent any Money Laundering. </p>
                    <h4>Enterprise-wide risk assessment</h4>
                    <p>As part of its risk-based approach, www.chc.casino has conducted an AML “Enterprise-wide risk
                        assessment” (EWRA) to identify and understand risks specific to www.chc.casino and its business
                        lines. The AML risk policy is determined after identifying and documenting the risks inherent to
                        its business lines such as the services the website offers. The Users to whom services are
                        offered, transactions performed by these Users, delivery channels used by the bank, the
                        geographic locations of the bank’s operations, customers and transactions and other qualitative
                        and emerging risks.</p>
                    <p>The identification of AML risk categories is based on www.chc.casino understanding of regulatory
                        requirements, regulatory expectations and industry guidance. Additional safety measures are
                        taken to take care of the additional risks the world wide web brings with it.</p>
                    <p>The EWRA is yearly reassessed.</p>
                    <p>Ongoing transaction monitoring</p>
                    <p>AML-Compliance ensures that an “ongoing transaction monitoring” is conducted to detect
                        transactions which are unusual or suspicious compared to the customer profile.</p>
                    <p>This transaction monitoring is conducted on two levels:</p>
                    <p>1) The first Line of Control:<br>
                        www.chc.casino works solely with trusted Payment Service Providers whom all have effective AML
                        policies in place as to prevent the large majority of suspicious deposits onto www.chc.casino
                        from taking place without proper execution of KYC procedures onto the potential customer. </p>
                    <p>2) The second Line of Control:<br>
                        www.chc.casino makes its network aware so that any contact with the customer or player or
                        authorized representative must give rise to the exercise of due diligence on transactions on the
                        account concerned. In particular these include:</p>
                    <p>Requests for the execution of financial transactions on the account;</p>
                    <p>Requests in relation to means of payment or services on the account;</p>
                    <p>Also, the three-step verification with adjusted risk management should provide all necessary
                        information’s about all costumers of www.chc.casino at all time.</p>
                    <p>Also, all transaction must be overseen by employees over watched by the AML compliance officer
                        who is over watched by the general management.</p>
                    <p>The specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager, possibly through their
                        Compliance Manager must also be subject to due diligence.</p>
                    <p>Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions essentially depends on a
                        subjective assessment, in relation to the knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial
                        behaviour and the transaction counterparty.</p>
                    <p>These checks will be done by an automated System, while an Employee crosschecks them for
                        additional security.</p>
                    <p>The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is difficult to gain a proper
                        understanding of the lawful activities and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered
                        atypical (as they are not directly justifiable).</p>
                    <p>Any www.chc.casino staff member must inform the AML division of any atypical transactions which
                        they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful activity or source of income known of the
                        customer. </p>
                    <p>3) The third Line of Control: <br>
                        As a last line of defence against AML www.chc.casino will do manually checks on all suspicious
                        and higher risk users in order to fully prevent money laundering. </p>
                    <p>If fraud or Money Laundering is found the authorities will be informed. </p>
                    <p>Reporting of Suspicious transactions on www.chc.casino</p>
                    <p>In its internal procedures, www.chc.casino describes in precise terms, for the attention of its
                        staff members, when it is necessary to report and how to proceed with such reporting. </p>
                    <p>Reports of atypical transactions are analysed within the AML team in accordance with the precise
                        methodology fully described in the internal procedures.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the information gathered, the AML
                        team: </p>
                    <p>will decide whether it is necessary or not to send a report to the FIU, in accordance with the
                        legal obligations provided in the Law of 18 September 2017;</p>
                    <p>will decide whether or not it is necessary to terminate the business relations with the customer.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Procedures </h4>
                    <p>The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards will be translated into operational guidance or
                        procedures that are available on the Intranet site of www.chc.casino.</p>
                    <h4>Record keeping</h4>
                    <p>Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be kept for at least ten years
                        after the business relationship has ended.</p>
                    <p>Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years following the carrying-out of
                        the transactions or the end of the business relationship. </p>
                    <p>These data will be safely, encrypted stored offline and online.</p>
                    <h4>Training:</h4>
