                    <h2>5. Glossary</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>5.1 Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules:<br>
                            "Single" – a bet on a single event;<br>
                            "Express" – this is a bet on the outcome of several different events simultaneously. When
                            you place a bet on the outcome of two or more events (for example, two different football
                            matches), you can unite them in "Express". To win an express bet it is necessary for you to
                            not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes which are included in the
                            Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet means loss throughout the entire bet.
                            Winnings of the express bets is equal the product of the bet amount at the coefficients of
                            played outcomes included in the express (if on one of the bets included in the express
                            occurs a return, then the coefficient on it equals to 1).<br>
                            "System" – a set of "express bets" of a particular set of events. Each combination of the
                            system is calculated as a separate express bet. To win in the system it is sufficient that
                            the indicated number of predictions of the total number be correct (it is defined by name,
                            that is, for example, in the system "3 of 4′′ it is necessary that 3 of the 4 predictions
                            prove correct, for "5 of 7′′ it is necessary properly to predict the outcome of the five
                            events of 7 options, etc.). It must be taken into account that because of the fact that only
                            a part of the total bet amount is specified on each of the express of the system bet
                            (proportional to the number of options) then the winnings by such a system bet will be less
                            than the possible general winnings by the express bet. In some cases, when not all outcomes
                            are predicted, the amount of winnings may be less than the amount of the bet, but in
                            contrast to express bets, a part of the amount will be offset on account of correctly
                            predicted outcomes.<br>
                            "Chain" – bet which is a combination of "single" bets including events independent from each
                            other. The sum of single bet of chain‘s each event is equal to the sum of chain. The client
                            is given a chance to determine independently the order of the bets included in the chain and
                            stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus the concept of "chain account" is imported.
                            After the tournament of each single bet included in the chain the sum of that account is
                            calculated. Initially it is equal to the sum of the first bet. If the sum on the chain
                            account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s next event’s single bet is calculated by
                            the account balance. The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on the order of bets
                            mentioned in the given ticket but not on time. The sum which remains on the account after
                            calculation of all bets in the chain is a subject to payment.<br>
                            If the sum on the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is considered to be
                            lost.<br>
                            "Handicap" – the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of competition, expressed in goals
                            (points/) sets, etc., which is provided by the bookmaker office to the entrant with bets on
                            it. The result of the event subject to the handicap is determined in this way: the handicap
                            given to the entrant is added to the corresponding result shown by the entrant in the
                            competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of the elected entrant, he is
                            considered as a winner, and the bets on his win subject to the handicap win. Payments are
                            carried out with the coefficient of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the
                            result is in favor of the opponent – the bets are lost. If the result subject to the
                            handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a result will be equal to 1
                            (return of the bet);<br>

                        </li>
                        <li>1) Suppose you want to bet upon the win of Cagliari subject to handicap. The handicap
                            betting on Cagliari (Handicap 2) is equal to "+1.5′′. To win with the bet on the handicap
                            "+1.5′′ it is necessary that Cagliari will not lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5
                            will be added to goals from Cagliari. Let us analyze all the options:<br>
                            - Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of 1 goal. For example,
                            the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result 2:2.5 in favor of
                            Cagliari (the handicap of Inter when determining the result on the rates at Cagliari is not
                            taken into account). The bets win.<br>
                            - Cagliari lost by more than 1 goal difference. For example, the final score is 2-0. Taking
                            into account the handicap (+1.5) the result is 2:1.5 in favor of Inter. In this case, the
                            rates on winning of Cagliari taking into account the handicap (+1.5) lose.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>2) Similarly, the following variants are possible when betting on a win for Inter taking
                            into account the handicap "-1.5":<br>
                            - Inter won having the advantage of two or more goals. For example, the final score is 3-0.
                            Taking into account the handicap (- 1.5) the result is 1.5:0 in favor of Inter. The bets
                            win.<br>
                            - Inter won having the advantage of 1 goal, teams drew or Cagliari won. For example, the
                            final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap -1.5, the result of the bets on Inter
                            at handicap (-1.5) gives 0.5:1, in favor of Cagliari. In this case, the bets on Inter with
                            the handicap -1.5 lose.<br>
                            Double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or total taking into
                            account the handicap, which is the multiple of 0.25 (but not of 0.5). Such bets are
                            calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum: with the same odd and "common handicaps" and
                            "common totals" multiple of 0.5’s near- by common value. In case when the Asian handicap is
                            included in parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in case of
                            single bet. In case of winning of two common bets, the bet’s odd "O" is taken into account
                            in the calculations. If one common bet is won and the other is a subject to refund, during
                            the calculation is taken the odd ("O"+1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet
                            considered lost.<br>

                                to "Accept all changes in the coefficients", "Accept only marked-up bets" or "Do not
                                accept bets if the coefficients change," which determines respectively whether the bet
                                is accepted if during the time of its arrangement the coefficient changed, at any
                                changes of it, or just in the case when the changed bet exceeds the estimated
                                coefficient of the bet of the client.</li>
                            <li>7.11 Incorrectly indicated date of the conducted match is not a ground for cancellation
                                of the bet.</li>

                                <li>9.1 The Company is not responsible for errors in typing, transfer or counting of
                                    bets. In particular, Www.chc.casino reserves the right to correct obvious errors
                                    made while entering information on betting coefficients and/or calculation of the
                                    amounts at the bets (for example, errors in the coefficients indicated in teams
                                    incorrectly, incorrectly indicated events, etc.), or declare invalid the
                                    corresponding bets even after completion of the event. In the cases of correcting
                                    obvious errors bets are returned. The most common types of technical errors are the
                                    following:</li>
                                <li>9.1.1 Errors of input of coefficients – when the coefficient (or the setting of the
                                    handicap/total, etc.) is displayed without a separator (dot) or with any additional
                                    number. Example: instead of the coefficient 1.8, 18 is displayed, instead of 2, 23
                                    is displayed, instead of 3, 30 is displayed etc.</li>
                                <li>9.1.2 "Mirror Errors" – when the coefficients for players are displayed in a
                                    diametrically opposite manner. In this case, the favorite of the game (including
                                    current favorite of live event) is displayed by a coefficient exceeding the
                                    coefficient of the outsider of the given event. Example: Basketball.
                                    Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. Instead of 1.2 and 4, 4and 1.2 is
                                    displayed.</li>
                                <li>9.1.3 Writing errors – if all the coefficients are indicated correctly, however,
                                    teams are written in an incorrect order (usually occurs for events taking place on a
                                    neutral field). Meaning for the previous example: record: Basketball.
                                    Unicaja-Barcelona. The winner of the match. 1.2 and 4 instead of Basketball.
                                    Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. 1, 2 and 4 Clear indicators of obvious
                                    errors are: very large difference in the coefficients of Www.chc.casino and other
                                    bookmakers, the coefficients that are nearly impossible to give in the current
                                    situation of the match. The right to determine whether or not an obvious or a
                                    technical error was made in any case belongs exclusively to Www.chc.casino. </li>
                                <li>9.2 Www.chc.casino reserves the right to abolish the bets made on deliberately
                                    incorrect coefficients and obvious errors. The customer will be informed about
                                    changes in the balance immediately.</li>
                                <li>9.3 Www.chc.casino reserves the right to cancel the bets even after the end of the
                                    event if these bets are won by the User as a result of a technical failure or an
                                    obvious error.</li>
                                <li>9.4 In cases when due to technical reasons the User’s bets were not provided with
                                    the necessary amount of funds in the account, the bets are considered as invalid.
                                </li>

                                    latter shall immediately notify Www.chc.casino about the mistake. If due to an error
                                    a negative balance has been formed at the client, the betting company has the right
                                    to cancel the uncalculated bets despite the fact that they were made before the
                                    error occurred.</li>

                                    and thereby the winning sum exceeds 100 000 USD, the bonus is not paid. -The maximum
                                    coefficient of a bet is 1000. In case it exceeds 1000, the winning is calculated

                        <p>The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial relations is a vital element,
                            both for the regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy. </p>
                        <p>This identification relies on the following fundamental principles:</p>
                        <p>A copy of your passport, ID card or driving license, each shown alongside a handwritten note
                            mentioning six random generated numbers. Also, a second picture with the face of the

                        <h3>Proof of Address:</h3>
                        <p>Proof of address will be done via to different electronic checks, which use two different
                            databases. If an electronic test fails, the user/customer has the option to make a manually
                            proof. A recent utility bill sent to your registered address, issued within the last 3
                            months or an official document made by the government that proofs your state of residence.
                            To make the approval process as speedy as possible, please make sure the document is sent

                            readable. For example: An electricity bill, water bill, bank statement or any governmental
                            post addressed to you. An employee may do additional checks if necessary, based on the
                            situation.</p>
                        <h3>Source of funds</h3>
                        <p>If a player deposits over a five thousand euro there is a process of understandings the
                            source of wealth (SOW)</p>
                        <p>Examples of SOW are:</p>
                        Ownership of business<br>
                        Employment<br>
                        Inheritance <br>
                        Investment <br>
                        Family <br>
                        <p>It is critical that the origin and legitimacy of that wealth is clearly understood. If this
                            is not possible an employee may ask for an additional document or prove. The account will be
                            frozen if the same user deposits either this amount in one go or multiple transactions which
                            amount to this. An email will be sent to them manually to go through the above and an
                            information on the website itself.</p>

                        Nationality<br>
                        Gender <br>
                        Date of Birth<br>

                            necessary based on the situation.</p>
                        <h3>Risk management:</h3>
                        <p>In order to deal with the different risks and different states of wealth in different regions
                            on the earth www.chc.casino will categorize every nation in three different regions of risk.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Region one: Low risk:</h4>
                        <p>For every nation from the region one the three-step verification is done as described
                            earlier.</p>
                        <h4>Region two: Medium risk:</h4>
                        <p>For every nation from the region two the three-step verification will be done at lower
                            deposit, withdraw and tip amounts. Step one will be done as usually. Step two will be done
                            after depositing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars), withdrawing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars) or
                            tipping another user/customer 500$ (five hundred Dollars.) Step three will be done after
                            depositing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars), withdrawing 2500$ (two thousand five
                            hundred Dollars) or tipping another user/customer 1000$ (one thousand Dollars). Also, users
                            from a low risk region that change crypto currency in any other currency will be treated
                            like user/customers from a medium risk region. </p>
                        <h4>Region three: High risk:</h4>
                        <p>Regions of high risks will be banned. High risk regions will be regularly updated to keep up
                            with the changing environment of a fast-changing world. </p>
                        <h3>Additional measurements.</h3>
                        <p>In addition, an AI which is overseen by the AML compliance officer will look for any unusual
                            behaviour and report it right away to a employee of www.chc.casino.</p>
                        <p>According to a risk based few and general experience the human employees will recheck all
                            checks which are done bevor by the AI or other employees and may redo or do additional
                            checks according to the situation. </p>
                        <p>In addition, a data Scientist supported by modern, electronic, analytic systems will look for
                            unusual behaviour like: Depositing and withdrawing without longer Betting sessions. Attempts
                            to use a different Bank account to for Deposit and Withdraw, nationality changes, currency
                            changes, behaviour and activity changes as well as checks, if an account is used by it´s
                            original owner. Also a User has to use the same method for Withdraw as he used for Deposit,
                            for the amount of the initial Deposit to prevent any Money Laundering. </p>
                        <h4>Enterprise-wide risk assessment</h4>
                        <p>As part of its risk-based approach, www.chc.casino has conducted an AML “Enterprise-wide risk
                            assessment” (EWRA) to identify and understand risks specific to www.chc.casino and its
                            business lines. The AML risk policy is determined after identifying and documenting the
                            risks inherent to its business lines such as the services the website offers. The Users to
                            whom services are offered, transactions performed by these Users, delivery channels used by
                            the bank, the geographic locations of the bank’s operations, customers and transactions and
                            other qualitative and emerging risks.</p>
                        <p>The identification of AML risk categories is based on www.chc.casino understanding of
                            regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations and industry guidance. Additional safety
                            measures are taken to take care of the additional risks the world wide web brings with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The EWRA is yearly reassessed.</p>
                        <p>Ongoing transaction monitoring</p>
                        <p>AML-Compliance ensures that an “ongoing transaction monitoring” is conducted to detect
                            transactions which are unusual or suspicious compared to the customer profile.</p>
                        <p>This transaction monitoring is conducted on two levels:</p>
                        <p>1) The first Line of Control:<br>
                            www.chc.casino works solely with trusted Payment Service Providers whom all have effective
                            AML policies in place as to prevent the large majority of suspicious deposits onto
                            www.chc.casino from taking place without proper execution of KYC procedures onto the
                            potential customer. </p>
                        <p>2) The second Line of Control:<br>
                            www.chc.casino makes its network aware so that any contact with the customer or player or
                            authorized representative must give rise to the exercise of due diligence on transactions on
                            the account concerned. In particular these include:</p>
                        <p>Requests for the execution of financial transactions on the account;</p>
                        <p>Requests in relation to means of payment or services on the account;</p>
                        <p>Also, the three-step verification with adjusted risk management should provide all necessary
                            information’s about all costumers of www.chc.casino at all time.</p>
                        <p>Also, all transaction must be overseen by employees over watched by the AML compliance
                            officer who is over watched by the general management.</p>
                        <p>The specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager, possibly through their
                            Compliance Manager must also be subject to due diligence.</p>
                        <p>Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions essentially depends on a
                            subjective assessment, in relation to the knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial
                            behaviour and the transaction counterparty.</p>
                        <p>These checks will be done by an automated System, while an Employee crosschecks them for
                            additional security.</p>
                        <p>The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is difficult to gain a proper
                            understanding of the lawful activities and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be
                            considered atypical (as they are not directly justifiable).</p>
                        <p>Any www.chc.casino staff member must inform the AML division of any atypical transactions
                            which they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful activity or source of income known of
                            the customer. </p>
                        <p>3) The third Line of Control: <br>
                            As a last line of defence against AML www.chc.casino will do manually checks on all
                            suspicious and higher risk users in order to fully prevent money laundering. </p>
                        <p>If fraud or Money Laundering is found the authorities will be informed. </p>
                        <p>Reporting of Suspicious transactions on www.chc.casino</p>
                        <p>In its internal procedures, www.chc.casino describes in precise terms, for the attention of
                            its staff members, when it is necessary to report and how to proceed with such reporting.
                        </p>
                        <p>Reports of atypical transactions are analysed within the AML team in accordance with the
                            precise methodology fully described in the internal procedures.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the information gathered, the
                            AML team: </p>
                        <p>will decide whether it is necessary or not to send a report to the FIU, in accordance with
                            the legal obligations provided in the Law of 18 September 2017;</p>
                        <p>will decide whether or not it is necessary to terminate the business relations with the
                            customer.</p>
                        <h4>Procedures </h4>
                        <p>The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards will be translated into operational guidance
                            or procedures that are available on the Intranet site of www.chc.casino.</p>
                        <h4>Record keeping</h4>
                        <p>Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be kept for at least ten
                            years after the business relationship has ended.</p>
                        <p>Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years following the
                            carrying-out of the transactions or the end of the business relationship. </p>
